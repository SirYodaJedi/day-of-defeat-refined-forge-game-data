Here, we host a thoroughly reviewed and improved version of the original `dod.fgd` file.

It is derived from the [Forge Game Data](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Day_of_Defeat_4.1.fgd) file available on the [Valve Developer Community website](https://developer.valvesoftware.com).

> [!NOTE]
> The last official version is technically `4.0`; `4.1` represents an [additional minor update](https://www.reddit.com/r/DayOfDefeat/comments/ufrt0q/updated_dodfgd_to_v41_added_game_player_equip/) shared on Reddit.

## Installation and Usage

Download and copy the `dod` directory from this repository to the `Half-Life` folder in your Steam installation directory; you will be prompted to replace the existing directory and files.

Next, set up your preferred level editor to use this file to design custom [Day of Defeat](https://store.steampowered.com/app/30/Day_of_Defeat/) maps.
