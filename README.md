This is the place where a completely reviewed and refined version of the original `dod.fgd` file is hosted.

> It is based on the [official Forge Game Data version 4.1](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Day_of_Defeat_4.1.fgd) file hosted on Valve Developer Community

## Installation and Usage

Transfer the `dod` directory from this repository into the `Half-Life` folder within your Steam installation directory; you'll be asked to overwrite the current directory and files.

Then, configure your favourite level editor to read and make use of this file.
